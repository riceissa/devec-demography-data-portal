<p><strong>Documentation on region.php</strong>: You need to include three parameters: region (which can typically take a value of a country, though some larger regions are also allowed), start_date (which is of the form YYYY0000), and end_date (which is of the form YYYY0000). Both start_date and end_date are inclusive. For instance, to get data for India from 1970 to 2010, use <a href="/region.php?region=India&start_date=19700000&end_date=20100000">/region.php?region=India&start_date=19700000&end_date=20100000</a>.</p>
